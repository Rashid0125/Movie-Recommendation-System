# Movie Recommendation System with Machine Learning

Recommendation systems are among the most popular applications of data science. They are used to predict the Rating or Preference that a user would give to an item.

Almost every major company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on auto play, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.

Let’s Build our own recommendation system
In this Data Science project, you will see how to build a basic model of simple as well as content-based recommendation systems.

While these models will be nowhere close to the industry standard in terms of complexity, quality or accuracy, it will help you to get started with building more complex models that produce even better results.

# Content Based Recommendation System

Now lets make a recommendations based on the movie’s plot summaries given in the overview column. So if our user gives us a movie title, our goal is to recommend movies that share similar plot summaries.
